# Android Clean Architecture Blueprint

In this project you'll find:
- Kotlin Coroutines for background operations.
- Hilt for DI.
- A single-activity architecture, using the Navigation component to manage fragment operations.
- A presentation layer that contains a fragment (View) and a ViewModel per screen (or feature).
- Reactive UIs using Coroutines and flow.
- A data layer with a repository and data sources.
- A domain level with use-cases.
